# Docker Status

Docker is NOT part of the current execution flow.

- The system currently runs directly via Python (venv / cron / manual).
- Docker artifacts exist for potential future use only.
- No Docker image is built, run, or deployed.
- No runtime logic references Docker.

Do not use Docker unless explicitly instructed.
